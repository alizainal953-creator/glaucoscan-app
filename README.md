# 🧠 GlaucoScan AI  
**Glaucoma GON Detection · IDSC 2026**

GlaucoScan AI is a deep learning–based diagnostic support system designed to detect **Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy (GON)** from retinal fundus images.

This project combines **CNN feature extraction + machine learning fusion** to achieve highly robust performance while minimizing data leakage through patient-level validation.

🔗 **Live Dashboard**: https://glaucoscanidsc.streamlit.app

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔍 EfficientNet-B3 Backbone for image feature extraction  
- 🧩 Late Fusion Strategy (Image + Quality Score)  
- 🤖 SVM (RBF Kernel) for final classification  
- 🔁 5-Fold Patient-Level Cross Validation (no data leakage)  
- 📊 Interactive Streamlit Dashboard  
- 📈 Ensemble prediction from all folds

## 📊 Model Performance

| Fold | Validation AUC |
|------|---------------|
| 0    | 0.9966        |
| 1    | 0.9805        |
| 2    | 0.9986        |
| 3    | 0.9904        |
| 4    | 0.9478        |
| **Mean** | **0.9828 ± 0.0188** |

✨ Ensemble across all folds improves robustness and generalization.

## 🛡️ Validation Strategy

We use Patient-Level K-Fold Split, ensuring:
- No data leakage between train & validation  
- Each patient appears in only one fold at a time  
- More realistic clinical evaluation
